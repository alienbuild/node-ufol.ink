I received a query from someone who was having issues embedding links on social media which linked to a particular site. The site in question wasn't setup correctly to handle multiple url params and due to the facebook suffix param that is placed on links it was causing the target site to not operate correctly. 

Both goo.gl and bitly would pass on these params also rendering them useless to solve the issue. With that in mind I decided to create ufol.ink.

## Technology
ufol.ink is a simple web app that is built from scratch using node, express, mongodb and react. 

## Installation
Clone or download 

Install by running the command:

`npm run client-install`

Start the server with:

`npm run dev`
